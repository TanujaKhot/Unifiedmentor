            <h2>What is Soil?</h2>
            <p>Soil is a natural resource that is vital for the growth of plants. It is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and countless organisms that together support life on Earth. Soil is a crucial component in agriculture, as it provides the necessary nutrients, water, and structure for plants to grow.Soil, the biologically active, porous medium that has developed in the uppermost layer of Earthâ€™s crust. Soil is one of the principal substrata of life on Earth, serving as a reservoir of water and nutrients, as a medium for the filtration and breakdown of injurious wastes, and as a participant in the cycling of carbon and other elements through the global ecosystem. It has evolved through weathering processes driven by biological, climatic, geologic, and topographic influences.</p>

            <h2>Types of Soil</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Clay Soil</h3>
                <p>Clay soil has very small particles, which makes it feel sticky when wet. It is high in nutrients but can be poorly drained and hard to work with.Clay soils contain more than 30 percent fine clay particles. Some clays swell and shrink as they wet and dry, which can add to soil fertility. Clay soils take longer to warm up in spring. Wet clay soils are easily damaged when dug or walked on. Drought is much less damaging on clay soils than others soil types.</p>

                <h3>Sandy Soil</h3>
                <p>Sandy soil has large particles, which makes it feel gritty. It drains quickly but doesn't hold nutrients well, making it less fertile.</p>

                <h3>Silty Soil</h3>
                <p>Silty soil has medium-sized particles and is smooth to the touch. It holds moisture better than sandy soil and is more fertile but can be easily compacted.Sandy soils are those that are generally coarse textured until 50 cm depth and consequently retain few nutrients and have a low water holding capacity. Soil management practices which lead to an increase in the fine fraction are helpful in improving soil properties and crop productivity.</p>

                <h3>Loamy Soil</h3>
                <p> What is Loamy Soil? Loamy Soil is the mixture of clay, sand and silt soil which consists of additional organic matter and is very fertile compared to other types of soil. It is well suited for cultivation as the plant roots get a sufficient amount of water and nutrients for their growth and development.Loamy soil is a mix of sand, silt, and clay, making it ideal for gardening. It is well-draining, fertile, and easy to work with.</p>

                <h3>Peaty Soil</h3>
                <p> Peat soil, known as one of the most problematic soils in the fields of civil and environmental engineering, is formed by the accumulation and decomposition of organic materials (derived from plant remains) under the waterlogged environment where there is lack of oxygen (O'Kelly, 2015).Peaty soil is rich in organic matter and retains a lot of moisture. It can be acidic and may need to be drained and fertilized for optimal plant growth.</p>

                <h3>Chalky Soil</h3>
                <p> Chalky or lime-rich soils may be light or heavy but are largely made up of calcium carbonate and are very alkaline (they have a. This describes how acid or alkaline soil is, and is expressed as a number between 0 and 14.Chalky soil is alkaline and can contain large stones. It drains well but can be low in nutrients and may require additional fertilization.</p>
